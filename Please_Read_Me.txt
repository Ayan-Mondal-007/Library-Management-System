Hello there this is Ayan..ðŸ˜Š

Before starting, I want to say something..
			 if you want to run every thing finely then read all of this first


	1. first to run the PHP files you need a server, so i recommend using "XAMPP" server.

	2.You can install it from internet very easily or watch some tutorial on YouTube "How to install XAMPP".

	3. then after installing XAMPP place this whole folder(i.e Library-Management-System) 

		into Where you installed
				   xampp > htdocs > root > Library-Management-System(i.e this folder)
					(if root doesn't exist then create one)

	4.now start XAMPP and start Apache and MYSQL will will be on stop state
	
	5.Then run XAMPP server and on a WebBrowser type localhost/phpmyadmin and run

	6.now there you will see on the top bar thers a option "import"  just click  on that

	7.after that a new page will open click on chose file option and chose a database file (i.e may be with .sql extension)

	8.for our case that is on this folder (Library-Management-System) named librarymanagement.sql
		and after chosing the file just click on import button on the bottom of the page.

	9. now you are ready to go.

	10.On a webBrowser type localhost/root and your root directory will open on webBrowser

	11. now click on the directory/folder (in our case i.e "Library-Management-System" )

	12.now we are Good To GO.
